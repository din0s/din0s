### Hi there, I'm dinos ðŸ‘‹

I am a proud alumnus of the University of Amsterdam where I completed my MSc degree in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html), with a deep interest in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. I've now embarked on an exciting journey as a full-time Research Engineer at [Zeta Alpha](https://zeta-alpha.com), where I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of Dense Retrieval methods and enhancing their performance through domain adaptation.

Leveraging my skills and knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, I'm committed to making positive contributions to society. I have a strong passion for the application of AI in search engines, recommender systems, and language understanding technologies. Now, as part of the Zeta Alpha research team, I'm actively engaged in contributing to the advancement of AI development within these realms.

Before my Master's studies, I obtained a BSc degree in [Computer Science](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where I specialized in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data & Web Management**. During my time there, I also took a leadership role in the university's [ACM Student Chapter](https://auth.acm.org/en/) (Member since 2018, Chair from 2019-2021), which allowed me to foster collaborations and develop mentorship opportunities within the local tech community.

I have a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, including C/C++, Java, Kotlin, Python and JavaScript, and have experience working with technologies such as Docker, Linux and SQL/NoSQL databases. Lately, I have focused on Machine Learning development, delving into frameworks such as **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **Lightning**, and **ðŸ¤— Transformers**.
