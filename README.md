### Hi there, I'm dinos ðŸ‘‹

I am a [MSc Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) student at the University of Amsterdam, with interests in **Machine Learning** and **Ethics in AI**.

Previously, I studied [BSc Computer Science](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/) at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and I was actively involved in the university's [ACM Student Chapter](https://auth.acm.org/en/) (Member since 2018, Chair during 2019-2021), where I had the chance to collaborate with many skilled people and share my knowledge on various topics with younger students of my programme.

I have experience with many programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and in the past I've worked on projects related to Bot (Discord), Mobile (Flutter and React Native) and Web (React and NodeJS) Development, which you can see in the pinned repositories below.

Here is a list of the languages that I have used the most in my recent projects:
