### Hi there, I'm dinos ðŸ‘‹

I study Computer Science in Greece and my interests are **Data Science** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

I like writing about topics that I am keen on, so I have created a [DEV.to profile](https://dev.to/din0s). Feel free to have a look at it! ðŸ˜„

I am also quite actively involved in the **ACM AUTh Student Chapter**, you can find our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/acmauth).

### My top projects

On my profile you will find some of my **personal projects** that I have developed in my free time, as well as some **university projects**!

These range from some where I am **trying to learn a new language/framework**, to a few where I showcase **what I can actually do**.

In summary, you can expect to find various projects related to:

ðŸ¥‡ **Discord Bot** Development ([JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA))

ðŸ¥ˆ **Full-Stack Web** Development ([React](https://github.com/facebook/react)/[Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node))

ðŸ¥‰ **Mobile App** Development ([Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter))

### My favorite languages

According to some _data-crunching âœ¨ magic_ âœ¨, here are the programming languages that I am most interested in:

I love exploring new fields and I am always up for a challenge, so if you have an idea, hit me up!
