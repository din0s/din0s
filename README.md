### Hi there, I'm dinos ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a MSc degree in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the University of Amsterdam, with interests in the fields of **Information Retrieval** and **Natural Language Processing**. Through my studies, I aim to deepen my understanding in **Recommender Systems**, **Adversarial Attacks** and **Explainable AI**.

I have a BSc degree in [Computer Science](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, with minors in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data & Web Management**. I was actively involved in the university's [ACM Student Chapter](https://auth.acm.org/en/) (Member since 2018, Chair during 2019-2021), where I had the chance to collaborate with many skilled people and share my knowledge on various topics with younger students of the local community.

I have experience with multiple programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Kotlin, Python and JavaScript, but also technologies such as Docker, Linux and SQL/NoSQL databases. Since the senior year of my bachelor studies I have mainly focused on Machine Learning development, delving into frameworks such as **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **Keras** and **PyTorch**.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have a neat idea that might be relevant to my interests!
