### Hi there, I'm dinos ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a MSc degree in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html) at the University of Amsterdam, with interests in the fields of **Information Retrieval** and **Natural Language Processing**. As a Research Intern at [Zeta Alpha](https://zeta-alpha.com), I am exploring the robustness and out-of-domain generalization of Dense Retrieval methods.

In the long term, I hope to use my skills and knowledge in Artificial Intelligence to make a positive impact on society. I am particularly interested in exploring how AI can be applied to search engines, recommender systems, and language understanding. After completing my MSc degree, I hope to join a research team that is working on related areas of AI development.

I have a BSc degree in [Computer Science](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/) from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, with minors in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data & Web Management**. I was actively involved in the university's [ACM Student Chapter](https://auth.acm.org/en/) (Member since 2018, Chair during 2019-2021), where I had the chance to collaborate with many skilled people and share my knowledge on topics such as software development and career growth with the local tech community.

I have a strong foundation in multiple programming languages, including C/C++, Java, Kotlin, Python and JavaScript, and have experience working with technologies such as Docker, Linux and SQL/NoSQL databases. Lately, I have focused on Machine Learning development, delving into frameworks such as **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, **Lightning**, and **ðŸ¤— Transformers**.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have a neat idea that might be relevant to my interests!
